ðŸ¥” Potato Freshness Detection Using CNN & Flask
This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects the freshness level of potatoes from images. The system is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of fresh and rotten potato images, and deployed using a Flask web server.

ðŸš€ Features
Trained CNN model for image classification (fresh vs rotten potatoes)

User-friendly web interface for uploading images

Real-time predictions using a locally served Flask app

Image preprocessing with PyTorch and PIL

Fully deployable Python project

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Python

PyTorch (for CNN model)

Flask (for backend API)

HTML/CSS/Bootstrap (for frontend)

Pillow & Torchvision (for image processing)
